        <h2> üéì Education</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Heidelberg, Germany, where I began my career with an apprenticeship as a car mechanic. This hands-on experience ignited my passion for modern technologies and automation.
          Building on this, I moved to Aachen to study Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Robotics.
          As my fascination with information technology and electronics grew, I expanded my academic journey by pursuing a degree in Mechatronics, ultimately earning a Master‚Äôs degree in the field.

        <h2> üõ†Ô∏è Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout my years at university, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant on innovative projects in systems engineering, robotics, and automation.
          Among my most exciting projects were those involving autonomous flying drones and self-regulating railway systems.
          Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer for Vehicle Control, where I continue to deepen my expertise in vehicle systems, control engineering, and automation technologies.
